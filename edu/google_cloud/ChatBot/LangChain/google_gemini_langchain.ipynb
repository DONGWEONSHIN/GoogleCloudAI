The function is designed to greet the person by returning a string that includes the greeting \"Hello\" followed by the person's name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how this function works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The function definition begins with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name `greet` and a pair of parentheses. The parentheses indicate that this function takes arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Inside the parentheses, we have a single parameter, `name`, which is typed as a string using the annotation `: str`. This specifies that the `name` parameter should be a string.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The function body is indented using four spaces. This indentation is essential in Python to define the scope of the function.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Inside the function body, we use an f-string (introduced with the `f` prefix) to format the greeting. F-strings are a convenient way to embed expressions inside strings.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The f-string contains the text \"Hello, \" followed by the `name` variable, which represents the person's name. The `{}` braces are used to embed the value of `name` into the string.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The formatted greeting is stored in a variable called `greeting`.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Finally, the function returns the `greeting` variable. This means that when you call this function with a name, it will return a string greeting the person by name.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, this `greet` function is a simple example of how to define and use a function in Python. It takes a person's name as input and returns a greeting message combining \"Hello\" with the person's name.\n"
